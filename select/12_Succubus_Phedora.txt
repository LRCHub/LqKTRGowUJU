You came to me in my sleep
A succubus all dressed in red
Filth that you whisper is sweet
But it's my dream so let it be said:

You must have taken the wrong turn
You've ended up in hell

Hear me, temptress of the night,
There is more than one demon here
I see temples I yearn to defile,
'Cause our horns hide divinity

And I think that the smell of your soft skin,
Is no less than the last legal drug
So here's my seditious and bold whim:
Let's drag the moon and make him watch

This grip will bloom into a bruise
These scars are your tattoos

Harlot, dying next to me
Is a pure ecstasy
What a night!
What a sight!
What a sin!

Your moans turn into screams
The beasts of lust unleashed!

This image is twisted, yet somehow attractive
As your make-up flows down and glues your eyelashes
The beads of sweat race on your neck as you're fighting,
Your creeps that I yield make it much more exciting
So I'll make you believe that God's not watching now,
Make you believe that you don't wanna stop,
Make you believe that you love to be hurt,
Make you believe you're as lonely as I am!

Succubus! Your horns are broken down
Succubus! Your wings are torn apart

Your screams become whispers,
And lords become slaves,
And yet we're still equals,
As we march to our graves

I said - "what kind of man would not succumb?"
You said - 'what kind of monster you've become?
You've become"
Oooh

Harlot, dying next to me
Is a pure ecstasy
What a night!
What a sight!
What a sin!

The dream faded away
The beasts inside remained
