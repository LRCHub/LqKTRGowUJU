These bitches burn they'll turn you cold if you're ain't [?] game
People lust, but their trust is someone they dont feel the same
Got no love for no bitch
Put it on me 'cause I know
I'da stuck my dick in niggas bitches throats across the globe, aye

These bitches burn they'll turn you cold if you're ain't about their game
People lust, but their trust is someone they dont feel the same
Got no love for no bitch
Put it on me 'cause I know
I'da stuck my dick in niggas bitches throats across the globe, aye

Off top
Let me laze you up, let me laze you up
Break you down
I'mma tell you why 'lil Xen can't give no fuck
I done been there, I done did it
Mistake love for codependence when we split
I was hunting with the pistol trying to kill her
I'm a murderist obsessive psychopathic motherfucker
I'll ride, I'll kill, I'll die if I love her
So I keep my fucking distance 'cause a bitch I can't trust
That's my word
Feeling [?] replace all my blood
