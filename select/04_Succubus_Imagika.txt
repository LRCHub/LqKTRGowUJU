Darling close your eyes
You knew our time was fleeting
Tonight we say goodbye
Promise me no tears

No don't go
Why so mysterious
If you must leave
Please take me with you

One last kiss good night
You know not what you ask me
A Hell of modern cries
Is all that awaits you

Don't turn away
For our love's eternal
If you must leave
I will follow you

An Angel's face, eyes of a demon
An unnatural glow
Just one of many reasons
Why I can't let you go
Remember back, I swore I'd follow you
Even to heaven
But that's not where we will go, I know
So if it must end tonight, I will follow you

Before you my life had no meaning
My world dead and cold
You showed me a world of wonders
So many that I feel reborn
Remember back I swore I'd follow you
Even to heaven
But that's not where we will go, I know
So if it must end tonight, I will follow you

If it must end tonight take me with you
Promise that you'll burn me slowly
If it must end tonight I welcome the flames
At least in the end we'll be together

If it must end tonight
I swear I'll follow you ever willing
If it must end tonight
I'd give my soul to you
I would die for you tonight

Your siren's voice calls me towards evil
How could it be wrong?
I'd embrace the fire forever
Just keep singing that sweet, sweet song
Remember back I swore I'd follow you
Even to heaven
But that's not where we will go, I know
So if it must end tonight, I will follow you

If it must end tonight take me with you
Promise that you'll burn me slowly
If it ends tonight I welcome the flames
At least in the end we'll be together
